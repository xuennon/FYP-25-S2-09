# User Suspension System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds user suspension checking to your Flutter Firebase app. Users with `suspensionStatus: 'yes'` in their Firestore document cannot login or continue using the app. Admin management is handled through your external landing page admin panel.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **User Profile Updates**
- Added `suspensionStatus` field to all user documents (default: 'no')
- Updated user creation process to include suspension status
- Added suspension checking methods for mobile app

### 2. **Login Flow Protection**
- Login process now checks suspension status after authentication
- Suspended users are automatically signed out with error message
- Demo accounts skip suspension check (configurable)

### 3. **Runtime Protection**
- User home page checks suspension status on load
- Suspended users are immediately logged out if detected
- Prevents suspended users from continuing to use the app

## Files Modified

### Modified Files:
1. `lib/services/firebase_user_profile_service.dart`
   - Added suspension status checking methods
   - Updated user creation to include `suspensionStatus: 'no'`

2. `lib/main.dart`
   - Added suspension checking in login flow
   - Prevents suspended users from accessing the app

3. `lib/user_home_page.dart`
   - Added runtime suspension checking
   - Automatic logout for suspended users

## Database Structure

### User Document Structure:
```json
{
  "uid": "user123",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "username": "Username",
  "displayName": "Display Name",
  "gender": "Male",
  "role": "user",
  "userType": "normal", // or "premium"
  "suspensionStatus": "no", // or "yes" (managed by landing page admin)
  "suspendedAt": "timestamp", // when suspended
  "unsuspendedAt": "timestamp", // when unsuspended
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "lastLoginAt": "timestamp",
  "lastUpdated": "timestamp"
}
```

## How It Works

### User Login Process:
1. User enters credentials
2. Firebase authentication occurs
3. **System checks `suspensionStatus`**
4. If `suspensionStatus` = "yes":
   - User is signed out immediately
   - Error message displayed
   - Login blocked
5. If `suspensionStatus` = "no":
   - Normal login proceeds

### Admin Suspension Process (External Landing Page):
1. Admin accesses your landing page admin panel
2. Admin changes user's `suspensionStatus` to "yes" in Firestore
3. User is immediately locked out of mobile app
4. Any active sessions will be terminated on next app interaction

### User Unsuspension Process (External Landing Page):
1. Admin accesses landing page admin panel
2. Admin changes user's `suspensionStatus` to "no" in Firestore
3. User can login normally again

## Mobile App Functions

The mobile app only handles **checking** suspension status, not managing it:

### Available Methods:
```dart
// Check if current user is suspended
bool isSuspended = await _profileService.isUserSuspended();

// Get suspension status string
String status = await _profileService.getSuspensionStatus(); // 'yes' or 'no'
```

## External Admin Management

Admin functionality should be implemented in your landing page with these capabilities:

### Required Admin Functions:
1. **View all users** with suspension status
2. **Suspend user**: Update `suspensionStatus` to "yes"
3. **Unsuspend user**: Update `suspensionStatus` to "no"
4. **Search users** by email/username
5. **View suspension statistics**

### Firestore Operations for Admin Panel:
```javascript
// Suspend a user
await db.collection('users').doc(userId).update({
  suspensionStatus: 'yes',
  suspendedAt: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
  lastUpdated: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
});

// Unsuspend a user
await db.collection('users').doc(userId).update({
  suspensionStatus: 'no',
  unsuspendedAt: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
  lastUpdated: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
});

// Get all users with suspension status
const users = await db.collection('users').get();

// Get only suspended users
const suspendedUsers = await db.collection('users')
  .where('suspensionStatus', '==', 'yes').get();
```

## Testing the System

### 1. **Test Workflow:**
1. Create a regular user account through mobile app
2. Login successfully to verify it works
3. Use your landing page admin panel to set `suspensionStatus: 'yes'`
4. Try logging in as the test user → Should be blocked
5. Use admin panel to set `suspensionStatus: 'no'`
6. Login should work again

### 2. **Manual Firestore Testing:**
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore
2. Find user document
3. Change `suspensionStatus` to "yes"
4. Try logging in → Should be blocked
5. Change back to "no"
6. Login should work

## Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**: All suspension checks require Firebase authentication
2. **Immediate Enforcement**: Suspension takes effect immediately on mobile app
3. **Runtime Checking**: Users are checked for suspension during app usage
4. **Automatic Logout**: Suspended users are automatically signed out
5. **External Admin Control**: Admin functions separated from mobile app

## Error Handling

- Graceful handling of network errors
- Fallback to "not suspended" if status cannot be determined
- User-friendly error messages
- Proper state management during suspension checks

## Integration Notes

- Demo accounts (`user@demo.com`) skip suspension checks by default
- All suspension management is external to the mobile app
- Mobile app only reads suspension status, never writes it
- Statistics and user management handled by landing page admin panel
- Real-time suspension enforcement on mobile devices

## Future Enhancements

1. **Suspension Reasons**: Add reason field for suspensions
2. **Temporary Suspensions**: Add expiration dates
3. **Push Notifications**: Notify mobile users of suspension/unsuspension
4. **Offline Handling**: Cache suspension status for offline scenarios
5. **Appeal System**: Allow users to request unsuspension through mobile app
