🧪 **TESTING THE USERNAME SYNC FEATURE**

📋 **Pre-Test Setup:**
1. Make sure you have Firebase rules deployed (check firebase_rules.txt)
2. Ensure you have some existing posts in your feed
3. Have at least one other user to test interactions

🔍 **Test Steps:**

**Step 1: Create Test Posts**
1. Open your app and login
2. Create 2-3 posts with your current username
3. Comment on some posts (both your own and others')
4. Note your current username in the posts

**Step 2: Update Your Username**
1. Tap on your profile avatar (top-left) OR tap "Profile" in bottom navigation
2. Tap "Edit" button in your profile
3. Change your username to something different (e.g., add "2024" to the end)
4. Tap "Save" button
5. You should see "Profile updated successfully!" message

**Step 3: Verify Automatic Sync**
1. You should automatically return to the home page
2. The posts list should refresh automatically
3. Check your posts - they should now show your NEW username
4. Check your comments - they should also show your NEW username
5. Other users' posts and comments should remain unchanged

🎯 **Expected Console Logs:**
- "🏠 HomePage: Navigating to MyProfilePage..."
- "🔄 Syncing username across posts..."
- "✅ Username sync completed: X posts and Y comments updated"
- "🏠 HomePage: Profile updated successfully, refreshing posts for username sync..."

✅ **Success Indicators:**
- Profile update shows success message
- Home page refreshes automatically
- All your posts show the new username immediately
- All your comments show the new username immediately
- No other users' content is affected
- UI updates without manual refresh needed

⚠️ **Troubleshooting:**
If usernames don't update:
1. Check Firebase Console for proper rules deployment
2. Look for error messages in console logs
3. Try manually refreshing the home page
4. Check your internet connection
5. Verify you have posts created by your account

🔧 **Technical Details:**
- EditProfilePage returns `true` when profile is successfully updated
- MyProfilePage passes this result back to UserHomePage
- UserHomePage automatically refreshes posts when receiving `true`
- FirebasePostsService.syncUsernameAcrossPosts() handles backend sync
- Batch operations ensure efficient Firebase updates

🎉 **What This Tests:**
- ✅ Profile username updates
- ✅ Automatic username sync across all posts  
- ✅ Automatic username sync across all comments
- ✅ UI refresh without manual intervention
- ✅ Data consistency across the app
- ✅ Performance with batch operations
- ✅ Navigation result passing between pages

This ensures that when users update their username, their identity remains consistent throughout the entire app! 🚀
