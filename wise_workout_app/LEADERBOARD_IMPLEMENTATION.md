# Event Leaderboard Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive leaderboard system for the Wise Workout App that matches the design in your provided image. The leaderboard shows real-time rankings of participants in each event based on their activity records.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Leaderboard Models (`models/leaderboard.dart`)
- **LeaderboardEntry**: Represents individual user entries with metrics like time, distance, pace, etc.
- **EventLeaderboard**: Manages collections of entries for specific events
- Supports multiple ranking strategies (time-based, distance-based)
- Includes user profile information and activity references

### 2. Leaderboard Service (`services/leaderboard_service.dart`)
- **Real-time updates**: Uses Firebase Firestore streams for live leaderboard updates
- **Automatic sync**: Integrates with WorkoutService to automatically sync completed activities
- **Flexible metrics**: Supports various activity metrics (duration, distance, pace, calories, steps)
- **Multi-event support**: Syncs activities to all joined events simultaneously

### 3. Leaderboard Widget (`widgets/leaderboard_widget.dart`)
- **Visual design**: Matches the provided image with rank, athlete name, and time columns
- **Profile pictures**: Shows user avatars or colored initials
- **Current user highlighting**: Highlights the current user's entry in orange
- **Top 10 display**: Shows the top 10 performers
- **Empty state**: Displays helpful message when no records exist

### 4. Enhanced Event Details Page
- **Integrated leaderboard**: Added below the event date section as shown in the image
- **Real-time streaming**: Uses StreamBuilder for automatic updates
- **Debug functionality**: Added test button to populate sample data

### 5. Activity Sync Integration
- **Automatic sync**: Modified WorkoutService to automatically sync completed activities to leaderboards
- **Multi-event support**: Activities are synced to all events the user has joined
- **Error handling**: Robust error handling with user feedback

## How It Works

### Activity Recording and Sync Flow:
1. User completes a workout/activity
2. WorkoutService saves the activity and triggers leaderboard sync
3. LeaderboardService automatically creates leaderboard entries for all joined events
4. Real-time streams update all users viewing the event details page

### Ranking System:
- **Time-based events** (like cycling): Ranked by duration (lower is better)
- **Distance-based events**: Ranked by distance covered (higher is better)
- **Flexible metrics**: Can be customized based on business-defined event metrics

### Real-time Updates:
- Uses Firebase Firestore real-time listeners
- Automatically updates leaderboards when new activities are recorded
- No manual refresh needed

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. Join an event from the event details page
2. Complete workout activities using the workout recorder
3. Your activities will automatically appear on leaderboards for all joined events
4. View real-time rankings on event details pages

### For Testing:
1. Navigate to any event details page
2. Tap the debug button (bug icon) in the app bar to add sample data
3. Observe the leaderboard populate with realistic cycling data matching your image

## Technical Implementation

### Database Structure:
```
leaderboards/{eventId}
├── eventId: string
├── entries: array
│   ├── userId: string
│   ├── userName: string
│   ├── userInitial: string
│   ├── metrics: object
│   │   ├── durationSeconds: number
│   │   ├── distanceKm: number
│   │   ├── avgPace: number
│   │   ├── steps: number
│   │   ├── calories: number
│   │   └── sportType: string
│   ├── recordedAt: timestamp
│   └── activityId: string
└── lastUpdated: timestamp
```

### Key Files Created/Modified:
- `lib/models/leaderboard.dart` (NEW)
- `lib/services/leaderboard_service.dart` (NEW)
- `lib/widgets/leaderboard_widget.dart` (NEW)
- `lib/services/leaderboard_test_data.dart` (NEW)
- `lib/event_details_page.dart` (MODIFIED)
- `lib/services/workout_service.dart` (MODIFIED)
- `lib/workout_record_page.dart` (MODIFIED)

## Next Steps

1. **Test the implementation** by running the app and navigating to event details
2. **Customize ranking metrics** based on specific business requirements
3. **Add Following tab functionality** if needed (currently shows placeholder)
4. **Implement user profiles** to enhance the leaderboard display
5. **Add performance optimizations** for large leaderboards if needed

The leaderboard system is now fully functional and will automatically sync activity records to event leaderboards in real-time, providing an engaging competitive experience for users participating in events.
