// 🔍 DEBUG: Username Sync Troubleshooting Guide

/*
📋 **If usernames are not updating after profile change, follow these steps:**

**Step 1: Check Console Logs**
When you update your profile, you should see these logs in order:
1. "🔄 Syncing username to "[new_username]" for user: [user_id]"
2. "✅ Firebase batch commit completed"
3. "🔄 Reloading posts from Firebase to ensure sync..."
4. "🎯 Successfully loaded [X] posts to feed"
5. "✅ Username sync completed: [X] posts and [Y] comments updated"

**Step 2: Test Manually**
You can test the sync manually by adding this temporary code to any page:

```dart
// TEMPORARY DEBUG CODE - Add to any page's build method
FloatingActionButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    final FirebasePostsService postsService = FirebasePostsService();
    print('🧪 MANUAL TEST: Current posts before sync:');
    for (var post in postsService.posts) {
      print('Post by ${post.username}: ${post.content.substring(0, 20)}...');
    }
    
    bool result = await postsService.syncUsernameAcrossPosts('TEST_USERNAME');
    print('🧪 MANUAL TEST: Sync result: $result');
    
    print('🧪 MANUAL TEST: Current posts after sync:');
    for (var post in postsService.posts) {
      print('Post by ${post.username}: ${post.content.substring(0, 20)}...');
    }
  },
  child: Icon(Icons.bug_report),
)
```

**Step 3: Check Firebase Console**
1. Open Firebase Console → Firestore Database
2. Go to the 'posts' collection
3. Find your posts (where userId matches your user ID)
4. Check if the 'username' field shows the updated value
5. Check comments array within posts for updated usernames

**Step 4: Verify Authentication**
Make sure you're properly logged in:
```dart
// Check current user
print('Current user ID: ${FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser?.uid}');
print('Current user email: ${FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser?.email}');
```

**Step 5: Force Refresh**
If automatic sync fails, you can force refresh:
```dart
// Add this to a button for testing
onPressed: () async {
  final FirebasePostsService postsService = FirebasePostsService();
  await postsService.loadFeedPosts();
  print('🔄 Force refreshed posts from Firebase');
}
```

**Step 6: Check Post Creation**
Ensure your posts were created with the correct userId:
- Open Firebase Console
- Check if your posts have the 'userId' field
- Verify the userId matches your authenticated user ID

**Common Issues:**

❌ **Issue 1: No userId field in posts**
- Solution: Delete old posts and create new ones with the updated Post model

❌ **Issue 2: Username sync appears to work but UI doesn't update**
- Solution: The updated code now calls loadFeedPosts() after sync

❌ **Issue 3: Firebase rules prevent updates**
- Solution: Deploy the updated Firebase rules from firebase_rules.txt

❌ **Issue 4: Network/timing issues**
- Solution: The code now includes a 500ms delay for Firebase propagation

**Success Indicators:**
✅ Console logs show sync completion
✅ Firebase Console shows updated usernames
✅ Posts in UI show new username immediately
✅ Comments show new username
✅ No error messages in console

**Next Steps if Still Not Working:**
1. Check Firebase Rules are deployed
2. Verify internet connection
3. Try logging out and back in
4. Create a new post to test with fresh data
5. Check if you have multiple Firebase projects configured
