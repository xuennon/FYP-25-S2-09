# Business Posts Integration - COMPLETE

## Overview
This document outlines the integration of business posts from the `businesspost` collection into the user homepage feed, including **title display functionality**.

## Changes Made

### 1. Post Model (`lib/models/post.dart`)

#### Added title field:
```dart
final String? title; // Add title field for business posts
```

### 2. Firebase Posts Service (`lib/services/firebase_posts_service.dart`)

#### Updated `loadFeedPosts()` method:
- Now loads both regular user posts and business posts
- Implemented parallel loading for better performance
- Separated loading logic into `_loadUserPosts()` and `_loadBusinessPosts()`

#### Added `_loadBusinessPosts()` method:
- Queries the `businesspost` collection
- Loads up to 25 business posts ordered by timestamp (newest first)
- Converts business post data to standard Post model

#### Updated `_convertBusinessPostToPost()` method:
- **✅ NEW: Extracts `title` field from business posts**
- Converts business post Firebase data to Post model
- Handles different field structures (e.g., `description` vs `content`, `imageUrl` vs `images`)
- Sets special `userAvatar` identifier: `'business_user'`
- Maps business name from various possible fields (`userName`, `username`, `businessName`)

#### Updated `_convertFirebaseDataToPost()` method:
- **✅ NEW: Sets `title: null` for regular posts**

#### Updated interaction methods:
- **`toggleLike()`**: Now handles both regular posts and business posts
- **`addComment()`**: Now handles comments on both post types
- **`deleteComment()`**: Now handles comment deletion for both post types

### 3. User Home Page (`lib/user_home_page.dart`)

#### Updated `_buildPostCard()` method:
- **✅ NEW: Displays business post titles prominently**
- Modified avatar section to use new `_buildUserAvatar()` method
- Added business badge for business posts
- Improved layout with `Expanded` widget for username section

#### **✅ NEW: Business Post Title Display**:
```dart
// Show title for business posts
if (post.title != null && post.title!.isNotEmpty && post.userAvatar == 'business_user') ...[
  Text(
    post.title!,
    style: const TextStyle(
      fontSize: 18,
      fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
      color: Colors.black87,
    ),
  ),
  const SizedBox(height: 8),
],
```

#### Added `_buildUserAvatar()` method:
- **Current User**: Shows UserAvatar widget (navigates to profile)
- **Business User**: Shows purple gradient circle with business icon
- **Regular User**: Shows default avatar with first letter of username

#### Business Post Visual Indicators:
- **✅ NEW: Bold title display above content**
- Purple gradient avatar with business icon
- "Business" badge next to username
- Distinguished visual identity for business posts

## Business Post Display Format

### Example from your Firebase data:
```
Firebase Data:
- title: "Hey it's me"
- description: "Im strong"
- userName: "ADLV"

UI Display:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [🏢] ADLV [Business]        31/07/2025, 18:04:12│
│                                                 │
│ **Hey it's me**          <- TITLE (Bold)       │
│ Im strong                <- DESCRIPTION         │
│                                                 │
│ [👍] [💬] [📤]                                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
