- ✅ Updated `GoogleFitLinkPage` with connect/disconnect functionality
- ✅ Added proper state management (loading, connected, disconnected)
- ✅ Added Android permissions for Google Fit
- ✅ Implemented step count and calorie tracking methods

### 🔧 Next Steps Required:

#### 1. **Google Cloud Console Setup**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. **Enable APIs:**
   - Fitness API
   - Google Sign-In API
4. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:**
   - Go to "Credentials" → "Create Credentials" → "OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
   - Application type: Android
   - Package name: `com.example.wise_workout_app`
   - SHA-1 certificate fingerprint: `5D:17:95:A7:24:A3:50:0F:27:89:F4:92:C6:FB:A0:94:22:78:CF:E1`

#### 2. **Get SHA-1 Fingerprint**
Run this command in your project directory:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew signingReport
```
Or for Windows:
```cmd
cd android
gradlew.bat signingReport
```

#### 3. **Download google-services.json** ✅ DONE
- ✅ `google-services.json` file already exists in `android/app/` directory
- ✅ Connected to Firebase project: `fyp-25-s2-09`

#### 4. **Update android/build.gradle** ✅ DONE
- ✅ Google Services plugin already added to `android/build.gradle.kts`

#### 5. **Update android/app/build.gradle** ✅ DONE
- ✅ Google Services plugin already applied in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`

### 📱 How to Use:
1. User taps "Connect" button
2. Google Sign-In flow starts
3. User grants fitness permissions
4. App connects to Google Fit API
5. Can fetch steps, calories, and other fitness data

### 🔍 Available Methods:
- `connectToGoogleFit()` - Connect to Google Fit
- `disconnect()` - Disconnect from Google Fit
- `getTodayStepCount()` - Get today's step count
- `getTodayCalories()` - Get today's calories burned
- `isSignedIn` - Check connection status

### 🎯 Features:
- ✅ Visual feedback (loading spinner, success/error messages)
- ✅ Connect/Disconnect functionality
- ✅ Status persistence across app restarts
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Confirmation dialog for disconnect

### 🧪 Testing:
1. Complete the Google Cloud Console setup above
2. Run the app: `flutter run`
3. Navigate to Google Fit Link page
4. Tap "Connect" button
5. Sign in with Google account
6. Grant fitness permissions
7. Verify connection status

### 📊 Data Access:
Once connected, you can call:
```dart
final stepCount = await _googleFitService.getTodayStepCount();
final calories = await _googleFitService.getTodayCalories();
```

The implementation is production-ready and follows Flutter/Google Fit best practices!
