# Search Page Team Joining Fix

## Issue Fixed
When a premium user created a team with unlimited members, the search page was still showing the team as "full" and preventing users from joining.

## Root Cause
The search page was using the old `joinTeam()` method instead of the new `joinTeamWithResult()` method that includes subscription-based member limit checking.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Team Joining Logic in `search_page.dart`
- **Before**: Used `_teamsService.joinTeam(team.id)` which didn't check subscription limits properly
- **After**: Used `_teamsService.joinTeamWithResult(team.id)` which returns detailed results with proper subscription validation

### 2. Enhanced Error Messages
- **Before**: Generic "Failed to join team" messages
- **After**: Specific messages like "This team has reached its member limit of 4 members. The team creator needs to upgrade to Premium for unlimited members."

### 3. Added Team ID to Navigation
- **Before**: Team details page didn't receive the team ID, causing subscription limit checking to fail
- **After**: Team ID is properly passed to `DiscoveredTeamDetailsPage` for accurate limit checking

### 4. Enhanced Member Count Display
- **Before**: Simple "X members" display
- **After**: Smart display showing:
  - "4 members / 4" for free teams at limit with "Full" indicator
  - "5 members Unlimited" for premium teams
  - Real-time subscription status checking

## Code Changes

### Team Joining Method Update
```dart
// OLD CODE
bool success;
if (isJoined) {
  success = await _teamsService.leaveTeam(team.id);
} else {
  success = await _teamsService.joinTeam(team.id);
}

// NEW CODE
bool success;
String message;
if (isJoined) {
  success = await _teamsService.leaveTeam(team.id);
  message = success ? 'Left ${team.name}' : 'Failed to leave ${team.name}';
} else {
  final result = await _teamsService.joinTeamWithResult(team.id);
  success = result['success'] as bool;
  message = result['message'] as String;
}
```

### Navigation Update
```dart
// OLD CODE
teamData: {
  'name': team.name,
  'description': team.description,
  'members': team.memberCount.toString(),
  'creator': team.createdBy,
  'createdAt': team.createdAt.toString(),
}

// NEW CODE
teamData: {
  'id': team.id, // Added team ID
  'name': team.name,
  'description': team.description,
  'members': team.memberCount.toString(),
  'creator': team.createdBy,
  'createdAt': team.createdAt.toString(),
},
initialJoinedState: isJoined, // Added initial state
```

### Enhanced Member Display
```dart
// NEW CODE - Dynamic member count with subscription awareness
FutureBuilder<int>(
  future: _teamsService.getTeamMemberLimitForTeam(team.id),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    final memberCount = team.memberCount;
    final limit = snapshot.data ?? 4;
    
    return Row(
      children: [
        Text('$memberCount member${memberCount > 1 ? 's' : ''}'),
        if (limit != -1) ...[
          Text(' / $limit'),
          if (memberCount >= limit) Text('Full'),
        ] else ...[
          Text('Unlimited'),
        ],
      ],
    );
  },
)
```

## Result
- ✅ Premium users' teams now correctly show "Unlimited" status
- ✅ Users can successfully join premium teams regardless of current member count
- ✅ Clear error messages explain subscription limitations for free teams at capacity
- ✅ Real-time subscription status checking and display
- ✅ Consistent behavior across search page and team details page

## Testing
1. Create a team as a premium user
2. Add more than 4 members
3. Search for the team in the search page
4. Verify the team shows "Unlimited" status and allows joining
5. Test with free user teams to ensure 4-member limit is still enforced
